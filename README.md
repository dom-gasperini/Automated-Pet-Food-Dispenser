# Automated-Pet-Food-Dispenser

This is my final project for my CS 121 course at UVM. This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4 to operate a machine that automaticlly dispenses food to one's pet at the usual meal times.
It also allows for manual input to dispense food on command, although hopefully your pet doesn't find out about that feature ;)
